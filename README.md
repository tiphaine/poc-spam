# poc-spam

Simple python script to train a RandomForestClassifier for spam/ham classification, model saving and querying.

I quickly wrote this to help out a friend who had spam issues on his website. This uses TF-IDF vectorizer only at the moment for features. Improved features will appear next if required.
